## Difference Between Type and Interface

Type and interface are both ways to define the shape of an object or a function in TypeScript. However, they have some differences in syntax, usage, and capabilities. Here are some of the main differences:

- Type can also be used to define other kinds of types, such as primitives, unions, and tuples, while interface can only be used for objects and functions¬π¬≤.
- Type supports the creation of a new name for a type, while interface provides a way to define the entities¬≤.
- Type can create an intersection type by combining multiple types into a single type, while interface cannot create any new intersection interface¬π¬≤.
- Interface can be extended or implemented by other interfaces or classes, while type can only be extended by using the & operator¬π¬≤.
- Interface allows declaration merging, which means that multiple declarations with the same name will be merged into one, while type does not allow this and will raise an error if two types have the same name¬π¬≤.
- Type is more flexible and expressive, while interface is more strict and clear¬≥‚Å¥.

In general, interface is preferred for describing object shapes and contracts, while type is more versatile and used for a broader range of type definitions‚Åµ. However, the choice between them depends on the preference and the situation of the developer. I hope this helps you understand the difference between type and interface in TypeScript. üòä

One major difference between type and interface in TypeScript is that type can be used to define other kinds of types, such as primitives, unions, and tuples, while interface can only be used to define object and function shapes¬π¬≤. For example, you can create a type alias for a string or number type, but you cannot create an interface for them.

Another difference is that type supports the creation of intersection types by using the & operator, while interface cannot create any new intersection interface¬π¬≤. For example, you can combine two types into one by using type Point = PartialPointX & { y: number; }, but you cannot do the same with interface.
